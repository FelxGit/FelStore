Cloning
1) composer install
2) npm install
3) artisan migrate && db:seed

/*every after fresh migrate*/
4) php artisan passport:install(to be able to generate access token)
5) artisan voyager:install(migrate and seeds to voyager generated/or to existing appended schema ex. user)

Validation
1) always validate the backend, front-end validations can be disabled and is merely used for server to avoid/recieve unaccepted values, and for faster process.
2) plugin/custom js validation vs embedded, either way they're javascript and might as well prefer plugin/custom js for flexibility

Extension for local
1) download ext for localhost(mysql_dll,mongo_dll,redis_dll)
