Laravel
1) composer install the latest package, make sure the current lara version is compatible. otherwise you may specify plugin/dependencies on composer.json
2) laravel ::create(), does one row at a time. while ::insert() could do more
3) 302 is a response redirect of laravel

vuex
1) some plugins installed via package manager like npm, may not as stable. You may try cdn.
2) Vue.component(comp,require) to require and use globaly
3) Vue.use() is to use plugin globally, Vue.component() is to use component globally
4) on reactive data() update, refrain from using []indexes. For existing object, use this.$set/Vue.set().
5) Vue 3 will bring state management along with its release, thus to have global-reactive data with vuex is probably not needed

Validation
1) always validate the backend, front-end validations can be disabled and is merely used for server to avoid/recieve unaccepted values, and for faster process.
2) plugin/custom validation vs embedded, either way they're javascript and might as well prefer plugin/custom validation for flexibility

Voyager
1) voyager:install will create a symlink in order to store avatar on storage/app
1) set the APP_URL to show admin avatar
