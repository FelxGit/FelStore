About
Fel Store is a one product checkout app

Laravel
1) composer install the latest package, make sure the current lara version is compatible. otherwise specify plugin/dependencies on composer.json
2) laravel ::create(), does one row at a time. but ::insert() could do more 

MongoDb
1) it seem laravel-mongo isnt stable yet( ex problem with eloquent query)
2) >with returns data with its nested relation to other model

Vue
1) how does custom event on router-view work? answer: if its not built-in event, its an $emit
2) sometimes, npm installs are not stable. had to put cdn script under index.html for it to work
3) Vue.component(comp,require) to require and use globaly
4) Vue.use() is must for vue-router only?
4) dont confuse import with php 'use', import is also similar to require(), but 
5) on reactive data() update, refrain from using []indexes. and for existing object, use this.$set/Vue.set(). Even tho Vue 3.0 eliminate this.  
6) Vue 3 will bring state management along with its release. thus to have global-reactive data with vuex is probably not needed. 
7) vuex ..map() provide reactivty than direct access
